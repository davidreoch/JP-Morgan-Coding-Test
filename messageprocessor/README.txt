Running Message Processor

Project has been configured to use a properties file (config.properties) which points towards, 
the input message file. If running from the JAR, the properties file needs placed in the same directory level as the JAR. 

If running from IDE, the config.properties must be placed inside the messageprocessor directory.
I have included an example input file and also included some unit tests to demonstrate the functionality.
